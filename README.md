Mr String wants his registration form to check the password has been re-entered correctly, and he wants the password to contain the following features:

· Password length between 8 and 12 characters

· Includes at least one upper-case letter

· Includes at least one lower-case letter

· Includes at least one number

Following discussion, Mr String has realised that teachers and students can freely access the IT Lab as there is no door security. He would like a digital security lock to be added to the door linked to the alarm system.

To open the door a 4-digit code will need to be typed into the keypad. If the code matches the stored code, the lock will display ‘Door unlocked’ if the code does not match the lock will display ‘Incorrect code’ and an alarm will sound.
